# GraphQL Notes API

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to create and query notes — so I can store and retrieve short entries.
- As a developer, I want to define a basic schema — so clients know the structure.

## Level 2 – Query Filtering & Mutations
- As a user, I want to filter notes by tag or date — so I can find relevant content.
- As a user, I want to update notes via mutation — so I can fix or revise them.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Subscriptions & Pagination
- As a user, I want to subscribe to note changes — so I get updates in real time.
- As a developer, I want to paginate query results — so large datasets load efficiently.
