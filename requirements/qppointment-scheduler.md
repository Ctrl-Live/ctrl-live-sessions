# Appointment Scheduler

## Level 1 – Core
- As a patient, I want to add a medical appointment with date, time, and doctor — so I don’t forget my schedule.
- As a patient, I want to see a list of upcoming appointments — so I can plan my time.

## Level 2 – Conflict & Management
- As a patient, I want to avoid booking overlapping appointments — so I don’t double-book.
- As a patient, I want to mark an appointment as completed or canceled — so I keep the list relevant.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Reminders & Sync
- As a patient, I want to receive automatic reminders — so I show up on time.
- As a patient who uses multiple devices, I want my appointments synced — so I can check them anywhere.
