# Lighting & Shading Visualizer

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to apply flat and Gouraud shading to 3D objects — so I can see different lighting models.
- As a user, I want to move the light source — so I can observe how shading changes.

## Level 2 – Phong & Normal Mapping
- As a user, I want to apply Phong shading — so the rendering appears more realistic.
- As a developer, I want to use normal maps — so I can simulate surface detail without more geometry.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Multiple Lights & Dynamic Shadows
- As a user, I want to add multiple light sources — so scenes have richer lighting.
- As a user, I want to render soft shadows — so lighting looks more natural.
