# Mini-Agent with Tool Use

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to give a task and get a multi-step answer — so I can solve complex problems.
- As a developer, I want to simulate tool use with simple "print" and "math" tools — so I can test agent logic.

## Level 2 – Dynamic Tool Execution
- As a developer, I want the agent to select tools and execute them — so it acts autonomously.
- As a user, I want logs of what the agent is doing — so I can understand the reasoning.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Add Web & Search Tools
- As a user, I want the agent to look up current data (e.g. weather, stock prices) — so it’s useful in real-time.
- As a developer, I want to add new tools dynamically — so I can expand the agent's capabilities.
