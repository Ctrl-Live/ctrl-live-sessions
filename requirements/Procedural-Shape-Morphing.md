# Procedural Shape Morphing

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to morph between basic shapes (circle → square → star) — so I can explore shape transformation.
- As a user, I want to adjust the duration and smoothness — so I control pacing.

## Level 2 – SVG & Custom Paths
- As a user, I want to morph between custom SVG paths — so I can animate logos or icons.
- As a user, I want to control anchor points — so the morphing appears intuitive and clean.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Live Path Drawing & Multi-Stage Transitions
- As a user, I want to draw shapes on canvas and morph them — so I can animate hand-drawn forms.
- As a user, I want to sequence multiple morphs in stages — so I can build complex shape storytelling.
