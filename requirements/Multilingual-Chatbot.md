# Multilingual Chatbot

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to chat in my native language — so I can interact comfortably.
- As a developer, I want to detect the user’s language — so I can translate as needed.

## Level 2 – Translation Support
- As a user, I want my messages translated into English for processing — so the model works properly.
- As a user, I want the model’s response translated back into my language — so I understand the reply.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Local Language Embeddings
- As a developer, I want to use embeddings in multiple languages — so semantic search still works.
- As a user, I want the bot to detect slang and regional expressions — so it's more conversational.
