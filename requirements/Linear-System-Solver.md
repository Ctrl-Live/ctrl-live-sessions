# Linear System Solver

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a system of linear equations — so I can find a solution using Gaussian elimination.
- As a user, I want the system checked for consistency — so I know if it has a unique, infinite, or no solution.

## Level 2 – Visual Solve Steps & Multiple Methods
- As a user, I want each step of the solving process shown — so I understand how the solution is derived.
- As a user, I want to solve using matrix methods (e.g. inverse, LU decomposition) — so I can explore alternative strategies.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Parametric Solutions & Real-Time Adjustment
- As a user, I want to explore systems with parameters — so I can understand how changes affect solution spaces.
- As a user, I want to dynamically drag equation coefficients via sliders — so I see how solution geometry shifts.
