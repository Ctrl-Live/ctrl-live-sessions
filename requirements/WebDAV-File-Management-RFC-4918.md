# WebDAV File Management (RFC 4918)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete files over HTTP — so I can manage remote content.  
- As a user, I want to query directory listings — so I can browse server resources.  

## Level 2 – Metadata & Locking
- As a user, I want to read and set file metadata — so I can store custom attributes.  
- As a user, I want to lock files during editing — so I can prevent conflicts with other users.  

## Level 3 – Collaboration Features
- As a user, I want to search server resources using WebDAV search — so I can find documents quickly.  
- As a user, I want to manage versioned resources — so I can roll back to previous file states.
