# NTP Client (RFC 5905)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to query an NTP server — so I can synchronize my local clock.  
- As a user, I want to adjust my system time based on server response — so I maintain accurate timestamps.  

## Level 2 – Redundancy & Accuracy
- As a user, I want to query multiple NTP servers — so I can improve accuracy and resilience.  
- As a user, I want to detect and avoid falsetickers — so I can ignore incorrect time sources.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Time Management
- As a user, I want to run as a background service — so time stays in sync automatically.  
- As a user, I want to log synchronization offsets — so I can monitor clock drift over time.
