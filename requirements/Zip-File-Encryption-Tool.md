# Zip File Encryption Tool

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to compress and encrypt a folder — so I can protect my files.
- As a user, I want to provide a password during encryption — so the archive remains secure.

## Level 2 – Unlock & Extract
- As a user, I want to extract the zip only after entering the correct password — so access is controlled.
- As a user, I want to see an error for incorrect passwords — so I know why the unzip failed.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Platform Portability & Auto-delete
- As a user, I want the encrypted archive to be compatible with popular unzip tools — so I can share with others.
- As a user, I want to delete the source files automatically after encryption — so my local data stays clean.
