# Prime Number Challenge

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a number — so I can check whether it’s prime.
- As a user, I want to generate the first N prime numbers — so I can study prime density.

## Level 2 – Sieve of Eratosthenes & Prime Factors
- As a user, I want to use a more efficient algorithm to find primes — so I can scale to larger inputs.
- As a user, I want to get the prime factorization of a number — so I can analyze its components.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Primality Test API & Visual Prime Spirals
- As a developer, I want to provide a web API that checks primality — so I can share it with others.
- As a user, I want to view prime distribution on a spiral grid — so I can see visual patterns.
