# Inventory Tracker

## Level 1 – Core
- As a store manager, I want to add items with a name and quantity — so I can track what's in stock.
- As a store manager, I want to update the quantity of an item — so I reflect changes after a sale or restock.

## Level 2 – Categories & Alerts
- As a manager, I want to tag items by category (e.g., electronics, stationery) — so I can organize inventory.
- As a manager, I want to see a warning when stock is below a threshold — so I can reorder on time.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Sync & Multi-device
- As a multi-branch store owner, I want inventory data synced to a server — so different branches stay in sync.
- As a mobile worker, I want to update stock from my phone — so I can work away from my desktop.
