# SIP Signaling for VoIP (RFC 3261)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to initiate and terminate SIP calls — so I can communicate over VoIP.  
- As a user, I want to register with a SIP server — so I can receive incoming calls.  

## Level 2 – Call Features
- As a user, I want to place calls on hold — so I can manage multiple conversations.  
- As a user, I want to transfer calls — so I can redirect communication to another party.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Signaling
- As a user, I want to support SIP over TLS — so call setup is encrypted.  
- As a user, I want to handle NAT traversal with STUN/TURN — so I can establish calls behind firewalls.
