# Product Wishlist App

## Level 1 – Core
- As a shopper, I want to save product names and URLs — so I can revisit them later.
- As a shopper, I want to mark products as purchased — so I can track what I’ve already bought.

## Level 2 – Organization
- As a shopper, I want to categorize products (e.g., gifts, home, tech) — so my list is easier to browse.
- As a shopper, I want to add notes to items (e.g., size, seller info) — so I remember details.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Sync & Accessibility
- As a user with multiple devices, I want my wishlist to sync — so I can access it from phone or desktop.
- As a user shopping while offline, I want to store my list locally and sync later — so I don’t lose access.
