# Basic 2D Drawing Engine

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to draw lines, circles, and rectangles on a canvas — so I can create simple shapes.
- As a user, I want to specify colors and stroke thickness — so I can control appearance.

## Level 2 – Layering & Undo
- As a user, I want to manage shapes in layers — so I can reorder them.
- As a user, I want to undo and redo drawing actions — so I can fix mistakes easily.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Export & Collaboration
- As a user, I want to export my canvas as an image — so I can share my artwork.
- As a user, I want to collaborate on the same canvas with others in real-time — so we can co-create drawings.
