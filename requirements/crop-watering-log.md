# Crop Watering Log

## Level 1 – Core
- As a farmer, I want to record when a crop was watered — so I know I’ve done it.
- As a farmer, I want to view the watering history per crop — so I can monitor irrigation.

## Level 2 – Improved Tracking
- As a farmer, I want to receive a notification when a crop hasn't been watered in 3 days — so I can avoid missed cycles.
- As a farmer, I want to tag crops by type (leafy, root, etc.) — so I can sort or group them.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Connectivity & Accessibility
- As a farmer who works across multiple fields, I want to access the watering log on mobile — so I can check and update it while outside.
- As a farmer with poor network coverage, I want the app to work offline and sync later — so I can still log activity in the field.
