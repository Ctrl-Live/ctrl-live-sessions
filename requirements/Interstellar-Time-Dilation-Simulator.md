# Interstellar Time Dilation Simulator

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input time spent near a gravity well — so I can calculate how much time passes elsewhere.
- As a user, I want to compare time experienced by astronauts and Earth observers — so I can understand relativistic effects.

## Level 2 – Planet Profiles & Visual Timeline
- As a user, I want to select from predefined planets with different gravity — so I can simulate missions.
- As a user, I want a visual timeline showing diverging clocks — so the impact is easier to grasp.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Multi-Astronaut Missions & Log Export
- As a user, I want to simulate crew splits where different people age at different rates — so I can model complex timelines.
- As a user, I want to export a mission timeline log — so I can analyze it later or share with others.
