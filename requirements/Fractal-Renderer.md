# Fractal Renderer

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to render a Mandelbrot or Sierpinski fractal — so I can observe self-similarity.
- As a user, I want to zoom into the fractal — so I can explore infinite detail.

## Level 2 – Color Mapping & Performance
- As a user, I want to color regions based on iteration depth — so the fractal looks more vivid.
- As a developer, I want to optimize rendering speed using a grid or parallelism — so zooming is smoother.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Web/Canvas Rendering and Shader Support
- As a user, I want to render fractals on a web canvas or GPU shaders — so performance is enhanced.
- As a developer, I want to export fractal animations — so I can create generative art.
