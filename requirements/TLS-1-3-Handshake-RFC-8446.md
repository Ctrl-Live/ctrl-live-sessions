# TLS 1.3 Handshake (RFC 8446)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to establish a TLS 1.3 secure session — so my communication is encrypted.  
- As a user, I want to verify the server’s certificate against trusted CAs — so I can confirm the server’s identity.  

## Level 2 – Performance & Resumption
- As a user, I want to use session tickets for 0-RTT resumption — so I can reconnect to a server quickly.  
- As a user, I want to negotiate the strongest mutually supported cipher suite — so I can maximize security.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Security
- As a user, I want to enable mutual TLS authentication — so both client and server verify each other’s identity.  
- As a user, I want to monitor and log handshake parameters — so I can audit for compliance and potential vulnerabilities.
