# Community Task Board

## Level 1 – Core
- As a volunteer, I want to post a task with a description and deadline — so others can help.
- As a community member, I want to claim a task — so I can contribute.

## Level 2 – Coordination & Status
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as in-progress or done — so everyone knows the status.
- As a user, I want to filter tasks by category or urgency — so I can prioritize.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Access & Device Support
- As a community leader, I want tasks synced across devices — so teams stay coordinated.
- As a user with spotty connectivity, I want to queue updates offline — so I can contribute without always being online.
