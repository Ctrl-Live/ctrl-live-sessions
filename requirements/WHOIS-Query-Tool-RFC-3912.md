# WHOIS Query Tool (RFC 3912)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to query WHOIS servers — so I can retrieve domain registration information.  
- As a user, I want to parse and display WHOIS responses — so I can read data in a clean format.  

## Level 2 – Server Selection
- As a user, I want to query the correct WHOIS server based on TLD — so I can get authoritative information.  
- As a user, I want to handle referral WHOIS servers — so I can follow response pointers automatically.  

## Level 3 – Automation & Export
- As a user, I want to export WHOIS data to CSV or JSON — so I can integrate it with other tools.  
- As a user, I want to schedule periodic WHOIS checks — so I can track changes in registration data.
