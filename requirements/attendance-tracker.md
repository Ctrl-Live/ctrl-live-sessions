# Attendance Tracker

## Level 1 – Core
- As a teacher, I want to mark students as present or absent — so I can track daily attendance.
- As a teacher, I want to see past attendance for each student — so I can identify patterns.

## Level 2 – Smarter Records
- As a teacher, I want to add short notes for each absence — so I can track reasons like sick leave.
- As a teacher, I want to export attendance data to a spreadsheet — so I can send reports to admin.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Centralised Records
- As a teacher in a multi-classroom school, I want attendance data to be synced to a central server — so the school admin has real-time access.
- As a teacher who travels between schools, I want to access the system on any device — so I’m not limited to my personal laptop.
