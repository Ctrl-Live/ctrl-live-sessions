# Document Q&A with Embeddings

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to upload a text file and ask questions — so I can retrieve relevant info.
- As a developer, I want to chunk the text and embed it — so the model can search semantically.

## Level 2 – Sources & Highlights
- As a user, I want answers with references to original chunks — so I can verify results.
- As a user, I want matching text to be highlighted — so I can spot the context quickly.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Multi-file & Offline Search
- As a user, I want to search across multiple files — so I can handle complex projects.
- As a user, I want to use local embeddings without internet — so I can run this offline.
