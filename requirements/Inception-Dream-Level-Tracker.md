# Inception Dream Level Tracker

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to create nested dream levels — so I can simulate time dilation and reality shifts.
- As a user, I want to track time within each level — so I see how long has passed outside.

## Level 2 – Events & Time Sync
- As a user, I want to add "kicks" to wake people up — so I can simulate dream collapses.
- As a user, I want to sync timers between levels — so I can plan actions across them.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Team Missions & Dream State Replays
- As a user, I want to assign characters to different dream levels — so I can simulate team missions.
- As a user, I want to replay dream events — so I can visualize the chain of actions.
