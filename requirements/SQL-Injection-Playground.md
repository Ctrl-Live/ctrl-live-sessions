# SQL Injection Playground

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a username and password to log in — so I can access a fake dashboard.
- As a tester, I want to manipulate the login input — so I can bypass authentication using SQL injection.

## Level 2 – Search Field Exploits
- As a user, I want to search by name — so I can trigger potential SQL injection in query strings.
- As a developer, I want to display the raw query used — so learners can see the injection in action.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Safe Refactor & Parameterization
- As a developer, I want to rewrite the queries using parameterized inputs — so the application resists injection.
- As a user, I want to test inputs after patching — so I confirm the vulnerability is mitigated.
