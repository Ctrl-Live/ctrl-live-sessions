# Mood Journal

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to log my mood for the day using a scale or emoji — so I can track emotional health.
- As a user, I want to add a short note about how I feel — so I can remember what influenced my mood.

## Level 2 – Trends & Reflection
- As a user, I want to see a weekly summary of mood entries — so I can notice patterns.
- As a user, I want to tag entries with causes (e.g., work, family) — so I understand what affects me.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Offline + Mobile
- As a user who journals daily, I want to use the app offline — so I’m not dependent on internet.
- As a user, I want to access my journal from multiple devices — so I can log entries wherever I am.
