# Insecure Deserialization Exploit

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to upload a profile as a serialized object — so the system can store and restore it.
- As a tester, I want to modify the serialized data — so I can inject unintended commands or values.

## Level 2 – Code Execution & Type Confusion
- As a developer, I want to deserialize objects from untrusted input — so I can demonstrate remote code execution (RCE).
- As a tester, I want to craft a payload that runs `alert()` or similar — so I can test injection.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Signed Tokens & Format Hardening
- As a developer, I want to verify object integrity using HMAC — so tampering is detectable.
- As a developer, I want to switch to JSON with schema validation — so object types are enforced.
