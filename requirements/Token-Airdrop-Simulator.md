# Token Airdrop Simulator

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to define a list of recipient addresses — so I can simulate a token airdrop.
- As a user, I want to specify the amount to send each — so the distribution is controlled.

## Level 2 – Conditional Rules
- As a user, I want to filter recipients by certain attributes (e.g., past activity) — so I only send to eligible wallets.
- As a developer, I want to preview the airdrop summary — so I can verify before "sending".

## Level 3 – Scaling: Real Transaction & Failover
- As a developer, I want to connect a wallet and actually send tokens — so the airdrop is live.
- As a user, I want retry logic for failed transfers — so I don’t lose recipients.
