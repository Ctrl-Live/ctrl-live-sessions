# Audio-Visual Synth Playground

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to generate basic tones and visualize them — so I can link audio and visuals.
- As a user, I want shapes to respond to volume — so I see motion tied to sound.

## Level 2 – Frequency Mapping
- As a user, I want to split audio into frequency bands — so each band drives different visuals.
- As a user, I want to control the resolution of the visualizer — so I can fine-tune clarity.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Modular Effects & Live Input
- As a user, I want to add reactive filters (glow, ripple, trails) — so the visuals feel expressive.
- As a user, I want to connect live mic input — so I can perform with my voice or instruments.
