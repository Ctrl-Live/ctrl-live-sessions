# Daily Expense Log

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to log an expense with amount, category, and date — so I can keep records.
- As a user, I want to view a list of expenses — so I can track my spending.

## Level 2 – Deeper Insights
- As a user, I want to view totals by category and time period — so I can analyze trends.
- As a user, I want to set monthly budgets — so I can be warned when I'm overspending.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Cross-device and Syncing
- As a user with multiple devices, I want my data to sync via the cloud — so I can use the app from anywhere.
- As a user with limited internet access, I want to enter expenses offline and sync when back online — so I don’t lose data.
