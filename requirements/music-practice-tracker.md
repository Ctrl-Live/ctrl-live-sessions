# Music Practice Tracker

## Level 1 – Core
- As a musician, I want to log each practice session with duration and instrument — so I can track my time.
- As a musician, I want to view a history of sessions — so I can see my consistency.

## Level 2 – Goals & Reflection
- As a musician, I want to set weekly practice goals — so I can stay motivated.
- As a musician, I want to rate how productive each session was — so I can reflect on quality.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Portability & Sharing
- As a student, I want to export or share my practice log — so my teacher can review it.
- As a mobile user, I want to track my practice on different devices — so I’m not tied to one device.
