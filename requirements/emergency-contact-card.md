# Emergency Contact Card

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to save my emergency contacts and basic health info — so someone can access it in an emergency.
- As a user, I want to mark one contact as "primary" — so responders know who to call first.

## Level 2 – Display Options
- As a user, I want to generate a simple printable card — so I can carry it in my wallet.
- As a user, I want to show a read-only version on my phone — so someone can see it without unlocking apps.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Medical Sync and QR Sharing
- As a user, I want to export my emergency info as a QR code — so it can be scanned quickly.
- As a user, I want to securely sync my contact card to a cloud profile — so I can update it remotely.
