# Man-in-the-Middle Attack Simulator

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to simulate a key exchange between two users — so I can learn how shared secrets are formed.
- As a developer, I want to introduce a third party that intercepts keys — so I can simulate an attack.

## Level 2 – Detection & Protection
- As a user, I want to see if an attacker altered a key — so I can detect compromise.
- As a user, I want to verify public keys via fingerprint comparison — so I can prevent MITM attacks.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Real-Time Warnings & Trust-on-First-Use
- As a user, I want to be warned when a public key changes — so I’m aware of suspicious activity.
- As a user, I want to trust keys on first use and flag any mismatches later — so I avoid false alarms.
