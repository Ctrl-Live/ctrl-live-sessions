# Prompt-Powered Q&A Bot (LLM Wrapper)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a question — so I can get an answer from an AI model.
- As a developer, I want to use a single-shot prompt to answer queries — so I can test basic model use.

## Level 2 – Prompt Templates & Context
- As a developer, I want to use prompt templates — so I can improve consistency of responses.
- As a user, I want to ask follow-up questions — so I can keep context between turns.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Session Storage & Personalization
- As a user, I want to store my chat history — so I can revisit past conversations.
- As a user, I want to define my preferences (tone, length) — so the bot responds the way I like.
