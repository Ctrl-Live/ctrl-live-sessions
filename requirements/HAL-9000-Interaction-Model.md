# HAL-9000 Interaction Model

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to ask the HAL-9000 questions — so I can receive replies in HAL's voice and tone.
- As a system, I want to respond to simple mission control commands — so I simulate HAL behavior.

## Level 2 – Error Simulation
- As a user, I want HAL to misinterpret or question certain commands — so the AI appears autonomous.
- As a user, I want HAL to simulate gradual breakdown — so I experience the dramatic arc.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Voice & Reactive Display
- As a user, I want the system to speak with HAL’s voice — so it feels authentic.
- As a user, I want a visual red HAL eye that reacts to input — so the immersion is cinematic.
