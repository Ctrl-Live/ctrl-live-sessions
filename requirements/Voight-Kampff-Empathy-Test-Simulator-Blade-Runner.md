# Voight-Kampff Empathy Test Simulator (Blade Runner)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to answer a series of emotionally charged questions — so the system can analyze my responses.
- As a system, I want to simulate empathy score calculations — so I can determine human vs. replicant.

## Level 2 – Custom Questions & Reactions
- As a user, I want to write my own question set — so I can explore different moral or emotional topics.
- As a system, I want to simulate emotional responses — so testers get feedback after each answer.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Multiplayer & Identity Obfuscation
- As a player, I want to test others anonymously — so I can guess who’s a replicant.
- As a system, I want to provide AI-generated dialogue — so every test feels different and unpredictable.
