# MIME Email Extensions (RFC 2045–2049)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to send and receive text messages in different character encodings — so I can handle multilingual content.  
- As a user, I want to detect and display email attachments — so I can access shared files.  

## Level 2 – Multi-Part Messages
- As a user, I want to handle multipart/alternative — so I can choose between plain-text and HTML versions of a message.  
- As a user, I want to handle multipart/mixed — so I can download attachments alongside message bodies.  

## Level 3 – Advanced MIME Types
- As a user, I want to send and parse inline images (multipart/related) — so I can view embedded visuals in HTML emails.  
- As a user, I want to properly encode and decode Base64 and quoted-printable content — so I can ensure compatibility across email clients.
