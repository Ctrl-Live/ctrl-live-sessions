# Matrix Operations Playground

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input two matrices — so I can add, subtract, and multiply them.
- As a user, I want the app to validate input dimensions — so I avoid invalid operations.

## Level 2 – Advanced Operations
- As a user, I want to compute matrix transposes and inverses — so I can explore transformations.
- As a user, I want to calculate the determinant — so I can check for invertibility.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Visualization & API Support
- As a user, I want to visualize matrix multiplication as a grid animation — so I can see how rows and columns interact.
- As a developer, I want to expose all operations via a REST API — so I can integrate it with other educational tools.
