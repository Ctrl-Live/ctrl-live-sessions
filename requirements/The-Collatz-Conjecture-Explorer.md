# The Collatz Conjecture Explorer

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a positive integer — so I can see the steps it takes to reach 1 using the Collatz rules.
- As a user, I want to see a count of steps taken — so I can compare how fast different numbers converge.

## Level 2 – Graph & Max Path
- As a user, I want to generate a graph of steps per number up to N — so I can see patterns.
- As a user, I want to find the number under N with the longest Collatz sequence — so I can analyze anomalies.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Server API & Historical Caching
- As a user, I want to query a web API to get Collatz steps — so I can integrate this into other tools.
- As a user, I want to cache previously computed steps — so performance improves on repeated runs.
