# AI Form Auto-Filler

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to provide basic profile data — so the model can fill out common forms for me.
- As a developer, I want to use LLM completions to auto-fill labels like “Full Name” and “Address”.

## Level 2 – Template Variations
- As a user, I want to auto-fill different types of forms (e.g. signup, job app) — so I save time.
- As a developer, I want to use prompt engineering to match specific form contexts — so the output fits better.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Privacy & Offline Use
- As a user, I want to run the form filler offline — so I don’t send data to external servers.
- As a user, I want to approve each field before submission — so I keep control over my data.
