# UUIDs (RFC 4122)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to generate UUIDv4 — so I can create random, unique identifiers.  
- As a user, I want to validate UUID strings — so I can detect malformed IDs before use.  

## Level 2 – Other Versions
- As a user, I want to generate UUIDv1 (time-based) — so I can sort identifiers chronologically.  
- As a user, I want to generate UUIDv5 (namespace + hash) — so I can create reproducible IDs from a name.  

## Level 3 – Advanced UUID Handling
- As a user, I want to detect UUID variants and versions — so I can handle them according to their specification.  
- As a user, I want to store UUIDs in compact binary form — so I can save space in databases.
