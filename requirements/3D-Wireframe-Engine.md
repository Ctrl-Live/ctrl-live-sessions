# 3D Wireframe Engine

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to render simple 3D wireframe shapes (cube, sphere) — so I can learn 3D geometry.
- As a user, I want to rotate the shapes — so I can view them from different angles.

## Level 2 – Camera & Lighting
- As a user, I want to move the camera in 3D space — so I can explore the scene.
- As a user, I want to add basic lighting — so I can get a sense of depth.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Scene Loader & Multiple Objects
- As a user, I want to load 3D objects from a JSON or OBJ file — so I can reuse models.
- As a user, I want to interact with multiple shapes in a scene — so I can simulate simple environments.
