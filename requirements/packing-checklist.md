# Packing Checklist

## Level 1 – Core
- As a traveler, I want to create a list of items to pack — so I don’t forget anything.
- As a traveler, I want to check off items — so I know what’s packed.

## Level 2 – Templates & Trips
- As a traveler, I want to reuse packing lists for similar trips — so I don’t start from scratch.
- As a traveler, I want to organize lists by trip — so I can plan multiple journeys.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Multi-device Sync
- As a traveler, I want my lists to be accessible across devices — so I can pack from any screen.
- As a backpacker with low connectivity, I want my list available offline — so I can use it anywhere.
