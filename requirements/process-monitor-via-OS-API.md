# Process Monitor via OS API

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to see a list of running processes — so I can know what's active on my system.
- As a user, I want to display the process ID and memory usage — so I can evaluate their footprint.

## Level 2 – Filtering & Sorting
- As a user, I want to filter by name or PID — so I can find specific processes.
- As a user, I want to sort by CPU or memory — so I can identify heavy resource usage.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Notifications & Cross-platform
- As a user, I want to receive an alert if a specific process exceeds memory — so I can react.
- As a developer, I want the tool to work on both Linux and macOS/Windows — so it's widely usable.
