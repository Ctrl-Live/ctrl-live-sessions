# Base64 Encoding (RFC 4648)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to encode binary data as Base64 — so I can transmit it over text-based protocols.  
- As a user, I want to decode Base64 strings — so I can retrieve the original binary data.  

## Level 2 – Variants
- As a user, I want to support Base64 URL-safe encoding — so I can use it in query strings and filenames.  
- As a user, I want to handle Base64 without padding — so I can meet certain API requirements.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Processing
- As a user, I want to process Base64 data in streams — so I can encode or decode large files without high memory usage.  
- As a user, I want to detect and reject malformed Base64 — so I can ensure data integrity.
