# IMAP Email Client (RFC 3501)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to connect to an IMAP server and authenticate — so I can access my mailbox remotely.  
- As a user, I want to list available mail folders — so I can navigate my inbox, sent items, and custom folders.  

## Level 2 – Message Retrieval & Flags
- As a user, I want to fetch message headers and bodies — so I can read my emails without downloading attachments unnecessarily.  
- As a user, I want to mark messages as read, unread, flagged, or deleted — so I can manage my inbox effectively.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Synchronization
- As a user, I want to maintain an offline cache of messages — so I can browse emails without an active connection.  
- As a user, I want to use the IDLE command — so I can receive push-style notifications for new emails.
