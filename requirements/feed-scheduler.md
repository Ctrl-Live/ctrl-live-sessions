# Feed Scheduler

## Level 1 – Core
- As a caretaker, I want to define feeding times for animals — so I don’t forget.
- As a caretaker, I want to mark an animal as “fed” — so I don’t feed them twice.

## Level 2 – Multiple Animals and Routines
- As a caretaker, I want to set different schedules for different species — so feeding is tailored.
- As a caretaker, I want to view a daily schedule sorted by time — so I can follow a plan.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Alerts & Offline Capabilities
- As a caretaker who works remotely, I want reminders even when offline — so I don’t miss a feeding time in areas without reception.
- As a team of caretakers, we want our updates synced in real time — so we can coordinate feeding tasks without overlap.
