# Sudoku Solver & Generator

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a Sudoku grid — so I can get a valid solution using backtracking.
- As a user, I want to validate whether a grid is solvable — so I can check puzzle integrity.

## Level 2 – Puzzle Generator
- As a user, I want to generate random solvable puzzles — so I can play or test my solver.
- As a user, I want to set puzzle difficulty — so I can choose between beginner and expert.

## Level 3 – Scaling: API Access & User Puzzle Sharing
- As a user, I want to save my puzzle to a public page — so others can try solving it.
- As a developer, I want to expose puzzle generation as an API — so external apps can use it.
