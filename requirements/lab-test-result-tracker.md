# Lab Test Result Tracker

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to record a lab test name, date, and result — so I can monitor changes over time.
- As a user, I want to sort results by date — so I can see my medical progression.

## Level 2 – Graphs & Comparisons
- As a user, I want to visualize test results over time — so I can notice improvements or problems.
- As a user, I want to add notes to results — so I can remember context (e.g., "had a cold that day").

## Level 3 – Scaling: Health Provider Sharing
- As a user, I want to export a PDF summary to share with a doctor — so they can see my records.
- As a patient, I want to sync test results from a provider’s portal (if available) — so I don't have to enter them manually.
