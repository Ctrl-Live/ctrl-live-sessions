# WebSocket Chat Server

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to connect and send messages in real-time — so I can chat with others.
- As a user, I want to see messages from others instantly — so the conversation feels live.

## Level 2 – Rooms & Usernames
- As a user, I want to join named rooms — so I can talk to specific groups.
- As a user, I want to set a display name — so others know who I am.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Persistence & Offline Notifications
- As a developer, I want to save messages in a database — so chats aren’t lost on restart.
- As a user, I want to get missed messages when I reconnect — so I don’t lose the conversation.
