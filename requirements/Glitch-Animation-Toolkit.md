# Glitch Animation Toolkit

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to apply basic glitch effects (RGB split, offset, noise) to images or text — so I can create cyberpunk-style visuals.
- As a user, I want to toggle the intensity and randomness — so I can fine-tune the effect.

## Level 2 – Timeline Control & Multi-Layer Glitch
- As a user, I want glitch effects to trigger at specific times — so I can choreograph them.
- As a user, I want to stack multiple glitch effects — so I can generate unique distortions.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Video Glitch & Interactive Triggers
- As a user, I want to apply glitch effects to a video stream — so I can remix real footage.
- As a user, I want to trigger effects using MIDI, mouse, or audio input — so I can perform visuals live.
