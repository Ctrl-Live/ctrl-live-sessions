# Markdown Syntax (RFC 7763 & RFC 7764)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to render Markdown headings, lists, and paragraphs — so I can create simple formatted documents.  
- As a user, I want to parse Markdown into HTML — so I can display it in a browser.  

## Level 2 – Extended Syntax
- As a user, I want to render links, images, and blockquotes — so I can enrich my documents.  
- As a user, I want to support fenced code blocks — so I can include syntax-highlighted code snippets.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Markdown Features
- As a user, I want to support tables and footnotes — so I can produce more complex technical documents.  
- As a user, I want to customize Markdown rendering rules — so I can adapt formatting to specific needs.
