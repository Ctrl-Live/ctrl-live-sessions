# Smart Contract Explorer

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to enter a smart contract address — so I can view its public methods and data.
- As a developer, I want to decode simple storage variables — so I can inspect contract state.

## Level 2 – Function Call Simulation
- As a user, I want to simulate read-only method calls — so I can test without spending gas.
- As a user, I want to decode event logs — so I can understand contract behavior.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Cross-Chain & ABI Loader
- As a user, I want to explore contracts across multiple blockchains — so I can compare and learn.
- As a developer, I want to load contract ABIs dynamically — so I don't hardcode structures.
