# RESTful Todo API

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to create, retrieve, and delete todos — so I can manage simple tasks via HTTP.
- As a developer, I want to follow REST conventions (GET, POST, DELETE) — so the API is predictable.

## Level 2 – Filtering & Status
- As a user, I want to filter todos by completion status — so I can see only what’s pending or done.
- As a developer, I want to update todos via PUT or PATCH — so users can mark tasks as completed.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Rate Limits & Versioning
- As a developer, I want to support versioned routes (e.g., `/v1/todos`) — so changes don’t break clients.
- As a developer, I want to apply rate limiting — so the API can handle many users gracefully.
