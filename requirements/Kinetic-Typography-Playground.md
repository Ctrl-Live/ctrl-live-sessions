# Kinetic Typography Playground

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want text to animate in using simple effects (fade, slide, scale) — so I can add motion to words.
- As a user, I want to sequence multiple lines of text — so I can create a short animated phrase.

## Level 2 – Easing & Timing
- As a user, I want to control easing curves (ease-in, bounce, etc.) — so my text flows more naturally.
- As a user, I want to sync animations to a timeline — so I can choreograph complex motion.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Audio Sync & Export
- As a user, I want text animations to match beats in audio — so I can make lyric videos or trailers.
- As a user, I want to export my animation as a video or GIF — so I can share it on social platforms.
