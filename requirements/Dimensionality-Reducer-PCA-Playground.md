# Dimensionality Reducer (PCA Playground)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to upload a dataset — so I can apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- As a user, I want to see how much variance each component explains — so I can decide how many to keep.

## Level 2 – Interactive Visualization
- As a user, I want to visualize my data in 2D or 3D after reduction — so I can spot clusters or patterns.
- As a user, I want to compare the original and reduced data — so I understand what was lost or preserved.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Large Datasets & Multi-Algorithm Comparison
- As a user, I want PCA to handle thousands of samples — so I can use it for realistic datasets.
- As a user, I want to compare PCA with t-SNE and UMAP — so I can choose the best dimensionality reduction method.
