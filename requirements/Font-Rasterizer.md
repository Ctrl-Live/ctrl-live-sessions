# Font Rasterizer

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to render basic text using bitmap or vector fonts — so I can display messages on screen.
- As a user, I want to change font size and alignment — so I can control layout.

## Level 2 – Kerning & Glyph Support
- As a user, I want to see glyph-by-glyph rendering — so I understand how fonts are built.
- As a developer, I want to adjust kerning and spacing — so typography looks natural.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Multilingual & OpenType Features
- As a user, I want to support multilingual fonts (e.g. Devanagari, Arabic) — so I can render global text.
- As a developer, I want to use OpenType ligatures and stylistic sets — so advanced text formatting is possible.
