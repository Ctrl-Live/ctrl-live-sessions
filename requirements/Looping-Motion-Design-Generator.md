# Looping Motion Design Generator

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to create a loop of moving shapes (e.g., rotating polygons, bouncing balls) — so I can learn about animation cycles.
- As a user, I want the loop to be smooth — so the start and end align seamlessly.

## Level 2 – Layering & Patterns
- As a user, I want to duplicate and layer elements — so I can create complex patterns.
- As a user, I want to animate colors and scale over time — so loops feel more dynamic.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Parametric & Randomized Generative Loops
- As a user, I want to define parameters (frequency, offset, seed) — so I can generate unique loops.
- As a developer, I want to generate hundreds of variations and preview them — so I can batch create visual assets.
