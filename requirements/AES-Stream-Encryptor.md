# AES Stream Encryptor

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to paste a text snippet and encrypt it — so I can copy-paste securely.
- As a user, I want to decrypt text using the same password — so I can retrieve it later.

## Level 2 – Clipboard Integration
- As a user, I want the encrypted output to be copied to clipboard — so I can paste it into messages.
- As a user, I want to decrypt encrypted clipboard content — so I can reverse the process easily.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Time-Limited Keys & Self-Destruct
- As a user, I want a key to expire after 10 minutes — so temporary secrets are safer.
- As a user, I want to self-destruct the decrypted message after reading — so it’s never stored in memory.
