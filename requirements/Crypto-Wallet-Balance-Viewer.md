# Crypto Wallet Balance Viewer

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a public wallet address — so I can see its current balance.
- As a user, I want to specify the network (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) — so I can check different chains.

## Level 2 – Transaction History
- As a user, I want to see recent transactions — so I understand wallet activity.
- As a user, I want to filter by date or token — so I can find relevant entries.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Multi-Wallet & Mobile Support
- As a user, I want to save and switch between multiple wallet addresses — so I can track multiple accounts.
- As a user, I want to view the app on mobile — so I can check balances on the go.
