# SFTP over SSH (RFC 4254 / RFC 4256)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to connect to an SFTP server via SSH authentication — so I can securely access files.  
- As a user, I want to list files and directories with details — so I can see permissions and sizes.  

## Level 2 – File Transfers
- As a user, I want to upload and download files — so I can synchronize local and remote storage.  
- As a user, I want to resume interrupted file transfers — so I can avoid re-uploading large files from scratch.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Features
- As a user, I want to change file permissions and ownership — so I can manage access rights.  
- As a user, I want to use public key authentication — so I can connect without entering passwords.
