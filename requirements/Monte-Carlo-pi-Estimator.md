# Monte Carlo π Estimator

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to generate random (x, y) points in a square — so I can estimate π by comparing them to a circle.
- As a user, I want to track how close the estimate is to π over time — so I can see convergence.

## Level 2 – Adjustable Precision & UI Feedback
- As a user, I want to set the number of points used — so I control performance vs. accuracy.
- As a user, I want a visual canvas showing the points — so I can see which fall in the circle.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Parallel Simulations & Statistics
- As a developer, I want to run simulations in multiple threads or clients — so estimation converges faster.
- As a user, I want a summary graph showing how variance decreases — so I can understand statistical behavior.
