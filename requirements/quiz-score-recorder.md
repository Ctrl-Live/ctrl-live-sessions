# Quiz Score Recorder

## Level 1 – Core
- As a tutor, I want to record a student’s quiz score — so I can track academic progress.
- As a tutor, I want to view past scores for a student — so I can monitor improvement.

## Level 2 – Analysis & Intervention
- As a tutor, I want to view average scores across subjects — so I can find weak spots.
- As a tutor, I want to flag students with low scores — so I can plan interventions.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Multi-device and Portability
- As a tutor working in multiple locations, I want quiz scores to be accessible across devices — so I can record scores from any classroom.
- As a tutor working with low-income students, I want the app to work offline and sync later — so I can still use it in areas with no Wi-Fi.
