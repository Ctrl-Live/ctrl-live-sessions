# iCalendar Data Format (RFC 5545)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to parse `.ics` files — so I can import calendar events into my app.  
- As a user, I want to generate `.ics` files — so I can share events with other calendar clients.  

## Level 2 – Event Management
- As a user, I want to handle recurring events — so I can represent repeating meetings.  
- As a user, I want to include event metadata (location, description, organizer) — so I can provide full scheduling details.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Features
- As a user, I want to process alarms and reminders — so I can notify users in advance.  
- As a user, I want to handle time zone definitions in calendar data — so events display correctly for all participants.
