# ISO 8601 Date and Time (RFC 3339 Profile)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to parse and format timestamps in RFC 3339 — so I can ensure consistent date/time representation across systems.  
- As a user, I want to validate input against RFC 3339 rules — so I can reject invalid timestamps.  

## Level 2 – Time Zones & Offsets
- As a user, I want to handle time zone offsets (`Z`, `+hh:mm`, `-hh:mm`) — so I can represent times in different regions accurately.  
- As a user, I want to convert between UTC and local time — so I can show users their preferred time format.  

## Level 3 – Extended Use
- As a user, I want to support fractional seconds — so I can record precise event times.  
- As a user, I want to normalize timestamps to a canonical format — so comparisons work reliably.
