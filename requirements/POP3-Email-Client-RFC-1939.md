# POP3 Email Client (RFC 1939)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to connect to a POP3 server and authenticate — so I can retrieve my email messages.  
- As a user, I want to list available messages with their sizes — so I can choose which ones to download.  

## Level 2 – Download & Delete
- As a user, I want to retrieve full message content — so I can read messages offline.  
- As a user, I want to delete messages from the server — so I can manage mailbox storage.  

## Level 3 – Reliability & Security
- As a user, I want to support TLS for secure POP3 connections — so my credentials and messages are protected in transit.  
- As a user, I want to leave messages on the server for a configurable number of days — so I can access them from multiple devices.
