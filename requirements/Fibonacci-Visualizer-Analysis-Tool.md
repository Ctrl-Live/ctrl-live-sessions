# Fibonacci Visualizer & Analysis Tool

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to generate the first N Fibonacci numbers — so I can study the sequence.
- As a user, I want to compute the nth Fibonacci number efficiently — so I can avoid slow recursion.

## Level 2 – Ratio & Golden Spiral Visualization
- As a user, I want to display the ratio of consecutive numbers — so I can see it converge to the golden ratio.
- As a user, I want to generate a golden spiral using the sequence — so I can visualize natural patterns.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Streaming & Real-Time Input
- As a user, I want the numbers to stream dynamically as I scroll — so I don’t wait for full recomputation.
- As a developer, I want a small client-side API — so the sequence is embedded in learning tools.
