# Password Manager (Local Storage)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to store usernames and passwords securely — so I don’t forget them.
- As a user, I want to unlock the password list with a master password — so only I can access it.

## Level 2 – Entry Tags & Search
- As a user, I want to tag entries (e.g., banking, social) — so I can filter easily.
- As a user, I want to search for accounts by name — so I can find them quickly.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Portable Vaults & Import/Export
- As a user, I want to export my vault securely to another device — so I can back it up.
- As a developer, I want the vault format to be JSON+AES — so it's readable and portable.
