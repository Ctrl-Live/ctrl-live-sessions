# Physics-Based Particle System

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to see particles emitted from a point — so I can simulate basic motion.
- As a user, I want to set velocity and gravity — so the particles feel natural.

## Level 2 – Forces & Interactions
- As a user, I want particles to bounce off surfaces or attract to a point — so I can create effects like explosions or swarms.
- As a user, I want to assign colors and lifespans — so particles fade and look dynamic.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Reactions to Audio & Input
- As a user, I want particles to react to music frequencies — so I can create audio-reactive visuals.
- As a user, I want to control emission via mouse or touch — so I can interact with the simulation live.
