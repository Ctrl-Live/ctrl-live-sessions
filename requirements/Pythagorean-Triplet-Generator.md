# Pythagorean Triplet Generator

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to generate a set of a, b, c values — so that a² + b² = c².
- As a user, I want to limit the maximum value of c — so I can explore smaller triplets first.

## Level 2 – Filtering & Visualization
- As a user, I want to filter results by whether the triplet is primitive — so I can focus on base sets.
- As a user, I want to see a triangle visualized — so I can understand how each triplet forms a right triangle.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Proof Explorer & Export
- As a user, I want to explore Euclid’s formula generation — so I can understand the derivation of triplets.
- As a user, I want to export a set of triplets — so I can use them in math exercises.
