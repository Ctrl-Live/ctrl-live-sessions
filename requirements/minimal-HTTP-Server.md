# Minimal HTTP Server

## Level 1 – Core
- As a developer, I want to serve static HTML files on port 8080 — so I can test basic HTTP functionality.
- As a developer, I want the server to respond with a 404 if a file is not found — so I understand error handling.

## Level 2 – Header Parsing & Routing
- As a developer, I want to parse incoming headers — so I can debug or log client requests.
- As a developer, I want to handle routes like `/api/hello` separately — so I can add basic API support.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Concurrency & File Uploads
- As a developer, I want the server to handle multiple clients — so I can support real-world usage.
- As a developer, I want to accept simple file uploads via POST — so I can experiment with multipart/form-data.
