# FTP Client (RFC 959)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to connect to an FTP server and authenticate — so I can access files.  
- As a user, I want to list directories and file details — so I can navigate remote storage.  

## Level 2 – File Operations
- As a user, I want to upload and download files — so I can transfer data between local and remote systems.  
- As a user, I want to create, delete, and rename files or directories — so I can manage remote content.  

## Level 3 – Security & Automation
- As a user, I want to use FTPS for encrypted connections — so my credentials and files are secure.  
- As a user, I want to script multiple transfers — so I can automate recurring file operations.
