# Habit Tracker

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to create a habit and mark it complete each day — so I can track consistency.
- As a user, I want to view a streak of days I completed a habit — so I stay motivated.

## Level 2 – Schedules & Notes
- As a user, I want to set habits to repeat only on certain days — so I don’t have to mark irrelevant days.
- As a user, I want to add a note to each day — so I can record what helped or hindered me.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Progress Insights
- As a user, I want to view charts of my habit trends — so I can see long-term progress.
- As a mobile user, I want to track habits offline and sync later — so I’m not limited by connectivity.
