# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Demo

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a base (g) and a prime (p) — so I can initiate key exchange.
- As a user, I want to generate and share public keys — so two parties can agree on a shared secret.

## Level 2 – Encrypted Message Exchange
- As a user, I want to encrypt a message using the shared secret — so I can send private messages.
- As a user, I want to decrypt incoming messages with the shared secret — so communication remains secure.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Multi-User Simulation
- As a user, I want to simulate multiple participants each with their own keys — so I can test secure group exchange.
- As a user, I want to view shared secrets in real-time — so I understand how keys evolve per participant.
