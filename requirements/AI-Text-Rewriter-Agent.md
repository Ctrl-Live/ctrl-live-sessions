# AI Text Rewriter Agent

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a paragraph and reword it — so it sounds more formal or concise.
- As a developer, I want to control style with a simple prompt variable — so the model adapts the tone.

## Level 2 – Style Presets & History
- As a user, I want preset styles like "email", "tweet", or "technical" — so I get consistent output.
- As a user, I want to undo and compare previous versions — so I can pick the best one.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Rewriting Large Docs
- As a user, I want to rewrite entire documents chunk by chunk — so I can process large files.
- As a developer, I want it to preserve structure and headers — so formatting is not lost.
