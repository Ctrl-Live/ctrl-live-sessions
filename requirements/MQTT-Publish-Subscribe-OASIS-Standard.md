# MQTT Publish/Subscribe (OASIS Standard)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to connect to an MQTT broker — so I can publish and subscribe to topics.  
- As a user, I want to publish messages to a topic — so subscribers can receive my data.  

## Level 2 – QoS & Retained Messages
- As a user, I want to use QoS levels 0, 1, and 2 — so I can balance performance and delivery guarantees.  
- As a user, I want to use retained messages — so new subscribers get the last known value immediately.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Features
- As a user, I want to authenticate with the broker using username/password or TLS client certs — so I can secure my connection.  
- As a user, I want to use MQTT over WebSockets — so I can connect from browsers and restricted networks.
