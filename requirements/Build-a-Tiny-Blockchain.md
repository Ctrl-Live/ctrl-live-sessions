# Build a Tiny Blockchain

## Level 1 – Core
- As a developer, I want to create blocks containing data — so I can simulate a blockchain structure.
- As a developer, I want each block to store a hash of the previous one — so I ensure immutability.

## Level 2 – Proof-of-Work
- As a developer, I want to add a proof-of-work mechanism — so blocks require computation to mine.
- As a user, I want to view difficulty and nonce values — so I understand how mining works.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Peer Sync & Fork Handling
- As a developer, I want to sync blocks with other nodes — so I simulate decentralization.
- As a developer, I want to resolve forks based on chain length — so the network agrees on a valid chain.
