# JSON Format (RFC 8259)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to parse JSON strings into objects — so I can work with structured data in code.  
- As a user, I want to serialize objects to JSON — so I can store or transmit them.  

## Level 2 – Validation & Edge Cases
- As a user, I want to detect invalid JSON (e.g., trailing commas, unescaped characters) — so I can reject bad input.  
- As a user, I want to handle UTF-8 encoding correctly — so I can work with multilingual data.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Processing
- As a user, I want to stream JSON parsing — so I can handle large files without loading them fully into memory.  
- As a user, I want to pretty-print JSON with indentation — so it’s easier for humans to read.
