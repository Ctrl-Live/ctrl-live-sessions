# NFT Metadata Viewer

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to enter an NFT contract and token ID — so I can view its image and attributes.
- As a developer, I want to fetch metadata from IPFS or HTTPS — so I understand where NFTs are stored.

## Level 2 – Batch Viewer
- As a user, I want to enter a wallet address and see all NFTs it owns — so I can browse collections.
- As a user, I want to sort NFTs by name or rarity — so I can navigate easier.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Gallery Mode & Offline Caching
- As a user, I want to browse NFTs in a visual grid — so it's easier to explore.
- As a developer, I want to cache metadata locally — so I can support offline or low-bandwidth use.
