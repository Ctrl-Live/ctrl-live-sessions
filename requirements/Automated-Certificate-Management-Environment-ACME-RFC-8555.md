# Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME, RFC 8555)

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to request a certificate from an ACME server — so I can enable HTTPS on my site.  
- As a user, I want to complete HTTP-01 or DNS-01 challenges — so I can prove domain ownership.  

## Level 2 – Renewal & Multiple Certificates
- As a user, I want to automatically renew certificates before expiry — so my services remain secure without manual intervention.  
- As a user, I want to request wildcard certificates — so I can secure all subdomains.  

## Level 3 – Advanced Security & Integration
- As a user, I want to store ACME account keys securely — so they cannot be stolen or misused.  
- As a user, I want to integrate ACME with my web server — so new certificates are deployed without downtime.
