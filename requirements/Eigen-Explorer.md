# Eigen Explorer

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a square matrix — so I can compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- As a user, I want the results explained — so I understand what they mean geometrically.

## Level 2 – Interactive Visualization
- As a user, I want to see how vectors change under matrix multiplication — so I can identify invariant directions.
- As a user, I want to highlight eigenvectors as directions that stay on their line — so I visually grasp their meaning.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Animate Vector Fields
- As a user, I want to animate a vector field under linear transformation — so I can understand system dynamics.
- As a user, I want to simulate real-world systems like population growth or vibrations — so I can see eigenvalue implications.
