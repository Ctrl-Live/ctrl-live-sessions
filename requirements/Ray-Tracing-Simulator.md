# Ray Tracing Simulator

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to trace a single ray hitting a surface — so I can see how light interacts.
- As a user, I want to compute simple shadows — so objects can cast darkness behind them.

## Level 2 – Reflection & Refraction
- As a user, I want reflective and transparent surfaces — so I can simulate mirrors and glass.
- As a user, I want to render scenes with multiple light bounces — so visuals are more realistic.

## Level 3 – Scaling: GPU Acceleration & Real-Time Support
- As a developer, I want to use WebGL or compute shaders — so rendering is faster.
- As a user, I want to export renderings as high-quality frames — so I can make animations or wallpapers.
