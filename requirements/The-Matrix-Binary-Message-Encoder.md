# The Matrix Binary Message Encoder

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input a text message — so I can see it represented as binary like in The Matrix.
- As a user, I want to decode binary back to readable text — so I can verify the message.

## Level 2 – Style & Themes
- As a user, I want to see falling green characters — so the interface looks like the Matrix.
- As a user, I want a terminal-style interface — so I feel immersed in the simulation.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Live Stream & Multiplayer Mode
- As a user, I want to chat in encoded binary — so we can simulate resistance communication.
- As a user, I want messages to appear live as falling characters — so the experience feels cinematic.
