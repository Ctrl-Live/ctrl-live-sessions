# 2D & 3D Vector Transform Visualizer

## Level 1 – Core
- As a user, I want to input 2D vectors — so I can see them plotted on a grid.
- As a user, I want to apply transformation matrices — so I can understand their effects.

## Level 2 – 3D Extension & Composition
- As a user, I want to toggle between 2D and 3D views — so I can visualize higher-dimension changes.
- As a user, I want to chain multiple transformations — so I can simulate real-world physics or animations.

## Level 3 – Scaling: Real-Time & AR Integration
- As a user, I want to manipulate vectors in real-time via sliders — so I can explore effects interactively.
- As a developer, I want to integrate with AR to show live transformations on physical surfaces — so learning becomes immersive.
